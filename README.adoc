# mariadb-docker-armhf-builder
:toc:

This image hosts the build stage for mariadb.

Since Mariadb compile process takes a lot of time, the build process has been splitted simply to keep every single stage build time unde the limits of Docker hub.
So this stage simply prepares the build environment.

## Build and run
 
```
docker build --tag mariadb-arm-stretch-builder:10.3 . 
docker run -t -i --entrypoint /usr/bin/qemu-arm-static mariadb-arm-stretch-builder:10.3 /bin/bash
```
